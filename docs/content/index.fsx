MessageRouter provides a framework for, and robust implementation of, 
in-process dynamic dispatch of messages to handlers, based on type. The
framework is expressed as interfaces, which are defined in the
MessageRouter.Common project. Meanwhile, the MessageRouter project provides
a component which fully orchestrates the dispatching in an asynchronous manner.
